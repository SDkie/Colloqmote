Getting Started
	Designed to harness the sensor resources available within the mobile phones for providing an alternate user interface to the computer.The raw sensor data fetched from sensors is transferred over Bluetooth to the computer where predefined events/actions are performed.

Modules
	Use Accelerometer of Mobile as motion sensing input device to the Computer.
	Use Hardkeypapad of Mobile as Gamepad.
	Use Accelerometer of Mobile for research.
	API for Scratch language.
	Use Mobile touch screen as Computer-Touchpad / Mouse
	Use Accelerometer for 3D model navigation.
	
Requirements
	Mobile
	J2ME powered Symbian platform
	Nokia Accelerometer sensor API
	Computer
	Java Runtime Environment
	An implementation of JSR-82 (e.g. Bluecove)
	Bluetooth drivers (e.g. WIDCOMM on Windows XP, or the built-in OS X drivers)
